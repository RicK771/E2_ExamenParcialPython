TI  - Population genomics and geographic dispersal in Chagas disease vectors: Landscape
      drivers and evidence of possible adaptation to the domestic setting.
PG  - e1010019
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1010019 [doi]
AB  - Accurate prediction of vectors dispersal, as well as identification of
      adaptations that allow blood-feeding vectors to thrive in built environments, are
      a basis for effective disease control. Here we adopted a landscape genomics
      approach to assay gene flow, possible local adaptation, and drivers of population
      structure in Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, an important vector of Chagas disease. We
      used a reduced-representation sequencing technique (2b-RADseq) to obtain 2,552
      SNP markers across 272 R. ecuadoriensis samples from 25 collection sites in
      southern Ecuador. Evidence of high and directional gene flow between seven wild
      and domestic population pairs across our study site indicates insecticide-based
      control will be hindered by repeated re-infestation of houses from the forest.
      Preliminary genome scans across multiple population pairs revealed shared outlier
      loci potentially consistent with local adaptation to the domestic setting, which 
      we mapped to genes involved with embryogenesis and saliva production. Landscape
      genomic models showed elevation is a key barrier to R. ecuadoriensis dispersal.
      Together our results shed early light on the genomic adaptation in triatomine
      vectors and facilitate vector control by predicting that spatially-targeted,
      proactive interventions would be more efficacious than current, reactive
      approaches.

TI  - Discovery and characterization of sweetpotato's closest tetraploid relative.
LID - 10.1111/nph.17991 [doi]
AB  - The origin of sweetpotato, a hexaploid species, is poorly understood, partly
      because the identity of its tetraploid progenitor remains unknown. In this study,
      we identify, describe and characterize a new species of Ipomoea that is
      sweetpotato's closest tetraploid relative known to date and probably a direct
      descendant of its tetraploid progenitor. We integrate morphological,
      phylogenetic, and genomic analyses of herbarium and germplasm accessions of the
      hexaploid sweetpotato, its closest known diploid relative Ipomoea trifida, and
      various tetraploid plants closely related to them from across the American
      continent. We identify wild autotetraploid plants from Ecuador that are
      morphologically distinct from Ipomoea batatas and I. trifida, but monophyletic
      and sister to I. batatas in phylogenetic analysis of nuclear data. We describe
      this new species as Ipomoea aequatoriensis T. Wells & P. Munoz sp. nov.,
      distinguish it from hybrid tetraploid material collected in Mexico; and show that
      it likely played a direct role in the origin of sweetpotato's hexaploid genome.
      This discovery transforms our understanding of sweetpotato's origin.

TI  - Genetic ancestry and ethnic identity in Ecuador.
PG  - 100050
LID - 10.1016/j.xhgg.2021.100050 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the ancestral origins of four Ecuadorian ethnic
      groups-Afro-Ecuadorian, Mestizo, Montubio, and the Indigenous Tsachila-in an
      effort to gain insight on the relationship between ancestry, culture, and the
      formation of ethnic identities in Latin America. The observed patterns of genetic
      ancestry are largely concordant with ethnic identities and historical records of 
      conquest and colonization in Ecuador. Nevertheless, a number of exceptional
      findings highlight the complex relationship between genetic ancestry and
      ethnicity in Ecuador. Afro-Ecuadorians show far less African ancestry, and the
      highest levels of Native American ancestry, seen for any Afro-descendant
      population in the Americas. Mestizos in Ecuador show high levels of Native
      American ancestry, with substantially less European ancestry, despite the
      relatively low Indigenous population in the country. The recently recognized
      Montubio ethnic group is highly admixed, with substantial contributions from all 
      three continental ancestries. The Tsachila show two distinct ancestry subgroups, 
      with most individuals showing almost exclusively Native American ancestry and a
      smaller group showing a Mestizo characteristic pattern. Considered together with 
      historical data and sociological studies, our results indicate the extent to
      which ancestry and culture interact, often in unexpected ways, to shape ethnic
      identity in Ecuador.

AB  - We sequence, assemble, and annotate the genome of Atopsyche davidsoni Sykora,
      1991, the first whole-genome assembly for the caddisfly family Hydrobiosidae.
      This free-living and predatory caddisfly inhabits streams in the high-elevation
      Andes and is separated by more than 200 Myr of evolutionary history from the most
      closely related caddisfly species with genome assemblies available. We
      demonstrate the promise of PacBio HiFi reads by assembling the most contiguous
      caddisfly genome assembly to date with a contig N50 of 14 Mb, which is more than 
      6x more contiguous than the current most contiguous assembly for a caddisfly
      (Hydropsyche tenuis). We recover 98.8% of insect BUSCO genes indicating a high
      level of gene completeness. We also provide a genome annotation of 12,232
      annotated proteins. This new genome assembly provides an important new resource
      for studying genomic adaptation of aquatic insects to harsh, high-altitude
      environments.

TI  - The genome sequence of the avian vampire fly (Philornis downsi), an invasive nest
      parasite of Darwin's finches in Galapagos.

LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkab414 [doi]
AB  - The invasive avian vampire fly (Philornis downsi, Diptera: Muscidae) is
      considered one of the greatest threats to the endemic avifauna of the Galapagos
      Islands. The fly larvae parasitize nearly every passerine species, including
      Darwin's finches. Most P. downsi research to date has focused on the effects of
      the fly on avian host fitness and mitigation methods. A lag in research related
      to the genetics of this invasion demonstrates, in part, the need to develop
      full-scale genomic resources with which to address further questions within this 
      system. In this study, an adult female P. downsi was sequenced to generate a
      high-quality genome assembly. We examined various features of the genome (e.g.,
      coding regions and noncoding transposable elements) and carried out comparative
      genomics analysis against other dipteran genomes. We identified lists of gene
      families that are significantly expanding or contracting in P. downsi that are
      related to insecticide resistance, detoxification, and counter defense against
      host immune responses. The P. downsi genome assembly provides an important
      resource for studying the molecular basis of successful invasion in the Galapagos
      and the dynamics of its population across multiple islands. The findings of
      significantly changing gene families associated with insecticide resistance and
      immune responses highlight the need for further investigations into the role of
      different gene families in aiding the fly's successful invasion. Furthermore,
      this genomic resource provides a necessary tool to better inform future research 
      studies and mitigation strategies aimed at minimizing the fly's impact on
      Galapagos birds.

TI  - Genomics of altitude-associated wing shape in two tropical butterflies.

AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to their local environment is central to
      evolution. With new whole-genome sequencing technologies and the explosion of
      data, deciphering the genomic basis of complex traits that are ecologically
      relevant is becoming increasingly feasible. Here, we studied the genomic basis of
      wing shape in two Neotropical butterflies that inhabit large geographical ranges.
      Heliconius butterflies at high elevations have been shown to generally have
      rounder wings than those in the lowlands. We reared over 1,100 butterflies from
      71 broods of H. erato and H. melpomene in common-garden conditions and showed
      that wing aspect ratio, that is, elongatedness, is highly heritable in both
      species and that elevation-associated wing aspect ratio differences are
      maintained. Genome-wide associations with a published data set of 666 whole
      genomes from across a hybrid zone, uncovered a highly polygenic basis to wing
      aspect ratio variation in the wild. We identified several genes that have roles
      in wing morphogenesis or wing aspect ratio variation in Drosophila flies, making 
      them promising candidates for future studies. There was little evidence for
      molecular parallelism in the two species, with only one shared candidate gene,
      nor for a role of the four known colour pattern loci, except for optix in H.
      erato. Thus, we present the first insights into the heritability and genomic
      basis of within-species wing aspect ratio in two Heliconius species, adding to a 
      growing body of evidence that polygenic adaptation may underlie many ecologically
      relevant traits.

TI  - Green, yellow or black? Genetic differentiation and adaptation signatures in a
      highly migratory marine turtle.
PG  - 20210754
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2021.0754 [doi]
AB  - Marine species may exhibit genetic structure accompanied by phenotypic
      differentiation related to adaptation despite their high mobility. Two
      shape-based morphotypes have been identified for the green turtle (Chelonia
      mydas) in the Pacific Ocean: the south-central/western or yellow turtle and
      north-central/eastern or black turtle. The genetic differentiation between these 
      morphotypes and the adaptation of the black turtle to environmentally contrasting
      conditions of the eastern Pacific region has remained a mystery for decades. Here
      we addressed both questions using a reduced-representation genome approach
      (Dartseq; 9473 neutral SNPs) and identifying candidate outlier loci (67 outlier
      SNPs) of biological relevance between shape-based morphotypes from eight Pacific 
      foraging grounds (n = 158). Our results support genetic divergence between
      morphotypes, probably arising from strong natal homing behaviour. Genes and
      enriched biological functions linked to thermoregulation, hypoxia, melanism,
      morphogenesis, osmoregulation, diet and reproduction were found to be outliers
      for differentiation, providing evidence for adaptation of C. mydas to the eastern
      Pacific region and suggesting independent evolutionary trajectories of the
      shape-based morphotypes. Our findings support the evolutionary distinctness of
      the enigmatic black turtle and contribute to the adaptive research and
      conservation genomics of a long-lived and highly mobile vertebrate.

LID - 10.7554/eLife.64165 [doi]
LID - e64165 [pii]
AB  - Invasive species represent one of the foremost risks to global biodiversity.
      Here, we use population genomics to evaluate the history and consequences of an
      invasion of wild tomato-Solanum pimpinellifolium-onto the Galapagos Islands from 
      continental South America. Using >300 archipelago and mainland collections, we
      infer this invasion was recent and largely the result of a single event from
      central Ecuador. Patterns of ancestry within the genomes of invasive plants also 
      reveal post-colonization hybridization and introgression between S.
      pimpinellifolium and the closely related Galapagos endemic Solanum cheesmaniae.
      Of admixed invasive individuals, those that carry endemic alleles at one of two
      different carotenoid biosynthesis loci also have orange fruits-characteristic of 
      the endemic species-instead of typical red S. pimpinellifolium fruits. We infer
      that introgression of two independent fruit color loci explains this observed
      trait convergence, suggesting that selection has favored repeated transitions of 
      red to orange fruits on the Galapagos.

TI  - Population genomics of invasive rodents on islands: Genetic consequences of
      colonization and prospects for localized synthetic gene drive.
PG  - 1421-1435
LID - 10.1111/eva.13210 [doi]
AB  - Introduced rodent populations pose significant threats worldwide, with
      particularly severe impacts on islands. Advancements in genome editing have
      motivated interest in synthetic gene drives that could potentially provide
      efficient and localized suppression of invasive rodent populations. Application
      of such technologies will require rigorous population genomic surveys to evaluate
      population connectivity, taxonomic identification, and to inform design of gene
      drive localization mechanisms. One proposed approach leverages the predicted
      shifts in genetic variation that accompany island colonization, wherein founder
      effects, genetic drift, and island-specific selection are expected to result in
      locally fixed alleles (LFA) that are variable in neighboring nontarget
      populations. Engineering of guide RNAs that target LFA may thus yield gene drives
      that spread within invasive island populations, but would have limited impacts on
      nontarget populations in the event of an escape. Here we used pooled whole-genome
      sequencing of invasive mouse (Mus musculus) populations on four islands along
      with paired putative source populations to test genetic predictions of island
      colonization and characterize locally fixed Cas9 genomic targets. Patterns of
      variation across the genome reflected marked reductions in allelic diversity in
      island populations and moderate to high degrees of differentiation from nearby
      source populations despite relatively recent colonization. Locally fixed Cas9
      sites in female fertility genes were observed in all island populations,
      including a small number with multiplexing potential. In practice, rigorous
      sampling of presumptive LFA will be essential to fully assess risk of resistance 
      alleles. These results should serve to guide development of improved, spatially
      limited gene drive design in future applications.

AB  - Aquatic environments are key niches for the emergence, evolution and
      dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. However, the population diversity and 
      the genetic elements that drive the dynamics of resistant bacteria in different
      aquatic environments are still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to
      understand the population genomics and evolutionary events of Escherichia coli
      resistant to clinically important antibiotics including aminoglycosides, in
      anthropogenic and natural water ecosystems. Here we show that less different E.
      coli sequence types (STs) are identified in wastewater than in rivers, albeit
      more resistant to antibiotics, and with significantly more plasmids/cell (6.36 vs
      3.72). However, the genomic diversity within E. coli STs in both aquatic
      environments is similar. Wastewater environments favor the selection of conserved
      chromosomal structures associated with diverse flexible plasmids, unraveling
      promiscuous interplasmidic resistance genes flux. On the contrary, the key driver
      for river E. coli adaptation is a mutable chromosome along with few plasmid types
      shared between diverse STs harboring a limited resistance gene content.

TI  - Microbial community characterization of shrimp survivors to AHPND challenge test 
      treated with an effective shrimp probiotic (Vibrio diabolicus).
PG  - 88
LID - 10.1186/s40168-021-01043-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an important
      shrimp bacterial disease caused by some Vibrio species. The severity of the
      impact of this disease on aquaculture worldwide has made it necessary to develop 
      alternatives to prophylactic antibiotics use, such as the application of
      probiotics. To assess the potential to use probiotics in order to limit the
      detrimental effects of AHNPD, we evaluated the effect of the ILI strain, a Vibrio
      sp. bacterium and efficient shrimp probiotic, using metabarcoding (16S rRNA gene)
      on the gastrointestinal microbiota of shrimp after being challenged with
      AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus. RESULTS: We showed how the gastrointestinal
      microbiome of shrimp varied between healthy and infected organisms. Nevertheless,
      a challenge of working with AHPND-causing Vibrio pathogens and Vibrio-related
      bacteria as probiotics is the potential risk of the probiotic strain becoming
      pathogenic. Consequently, we evaluated whether ILI strain can acquire the plasmid
      pV-AHPND via horizontal transfer and further cause the disease in shrimp.
      Conjugation assays were performed resulting in a high frequency (70%) of colonies
      harboring the pv-AHPND. However, no shrimp mortality was observed when
      transconjugant colonies of the ILI strain were used in a challenge test using
      healthy shrimp. We sequenced the genome of the ILI strain and performed
      comparative genomics analyses using AHPND and non-AHPND Vibrio isolates. Using
      available phylogenetic and phylogenomics analyses, we reclassified the ILI strain
      as Vibrio diabolicus. In summary, this work represents an effort to study the
      role that probiotics play in the normal gastrointestinal shrimp microbiome and in
      AHPND-infected shrimp, showing that the ILI probiotic was able to control
      pathogenic bacterial populations in the host's gastrointestinal tract and
      stimulate the shrimp's survival. The identification of probiotic bacterial
      species that are effective in the host's colonization is important to promote
      animal health and prevent disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes probiotic
      bacteria capable of controlling pathogenic populations of bacteria in the shrimp 
      gastrointestinal tract. Our work provides new insights into the complex dynamics 
      between shrimp and the changes in the microbiota. It also addresses the practical
      application of probiotics to solve problems with pathogens that cause high
      mortality-rate in shrimp farming around the world. Video Abstract.

AB  - Evolutionary dynamics at the population level play a central role in creating the
      diversity of life on our planet. In this study, we sought to understand the
      origins of such population-level variation in mating systems and defensive
      acylsugar chemistry in Solanum habrochaites-a wild tomato species found in
      diverse Andean habitats in Ecuador and Peru. Using
      Restriction-site-Associated-DNA-Sequencing (RAD-seq) of 50 S. habrochaites
      accessions, we identified eight population clusters generated via isolation and
      hybridization dynamics of 4-6 ancestral populations. Detailed characterization of
      mating systems of these clusters revealed emergence of multiple self-compatible
      (SC) groups from progenitor self-incompatible populations in the northern part of
      the species range. Emergence of these SC groups was also associated with fixation
      of deleterious alleles inactivating acylsugar acetylation. The
      Amotape-Huancabamba Zone-a geographical landmark in the Andes with high endemism 
      and isolated microhabitats-was identified as a major driver of differentiation in
      the northern species range, whereas large geographical distances contributed to
      population structure and evolution of a novel SC group in the central and
      southern parts of the range, where the species was also inferred to have
      originated. Findings presented here highlight the role of the diverse
      ecogeography of Peru and Ecuador in generating population differentiation, and
      enhance our understanding of the microevolutionary processes that create
      biological diversity.

LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2021.614665 [doi]
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, a zoonotic kinetoplastid protozoan parasite, is the causative 
      agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). Having a very plastic,
      repetitive and complex genome, the parasite displays a highly diverse repertoire 
      of surface molecules, with pivotal roles in cell invasion, immune evasion and
      pathogenesis. Before 2016, the complexity of the genomic regions containing these
      genes impaired the assembly of a genome at chromosomal level, making it
      impossible to study the structure and function of the several thousand repetitive
      genes encoding the surface molecules of the parasite. We here describe the genome
      assembly of the Sylvio X10/1 genome sequence, which since 2016 has been used as a
      reference genome sequence for T. cruzi clade I (TcI), produced using high
      coverage PacBio single-molecule sequencing. It was used to analyze deep Illumina 
      sequence data from 34 T. cruzi TcI isolates and clones from different geographic 
      locations, sample sources and clinical outcomes. Resolution of the surface
      molecule gene distribution showed the unusual duality in the organization of the 
      parasite genome, a synteny of the core genomic region with related protozoa
      flanked by unique and highly plastic multigene family clusters encoding surface
      antigens. The presence of abundant interspersed retrotransposons in these
      multigene family clusters suggests that these elements are involved in a
      recombination mechanism for the generation of antigenic variation and evasion of 
      the host immune response on these TcI strains. The comparative genomic analysis
      of the cohort of TcI strains revealed multiple cases of such recombination events
      involving surface molecule genes and has provided new insights into T. cruzi
      population structure.

TI  - Genomic Analysis, Progress and Future Perspectives in Dairy Cattle Selection: A
      Review.
LID - 599 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani11030599 [doi]
AB  - Genomics comprises a set of current and valuable technologies implemented as
      selection tools in dairy cattle commercial breeding programs. The intensive
      progeny testing for production and reproductive traits based on genomic breeding 
      values (GEBVs) has been crucial to increasing dairy cattle productivity. The
      knowledge of key genes and haplotypes, including their regulation mechanisms, as 
      markers for productivity traits, may improve the strategies on the present and
      future for dairy cattle selection. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) such as
      quantitative trait loci (QTL), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or
      single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) methods have
      already been included in global dairy programs for the estimation of
      marker-assisted selection-derived effects. The increase in genetic progress based
      on genomic predicting accuracy has also contributed to the understanding of
      genetic effects in dairy cattle offspring. However, the crossing within
      inbred-lines critically increased homozygosis with accumulated negative effects
      of inbreeding like a decline in reproductive performance. Thus, inaccurate-biased
      estimations based on empirical-conventional models of dairy production systems
      face an increased risk of providing suboptimal results derived from errors in the
      selection of candidates of high genetic merit-based just on low-heritability
      phenotypic traits. This extends the generation intervals and increases costs due 
      to the significant reduction of genetic gains. The remarkable progress of genomic
      prediction increases the accurate selection of superior candidates. The scope of 
      the present review is to summarize and discuss the advances and challenges of
      genomic tools for dairy cattle selection for optimizing breeding programs and
      controlling negative inbreeding depression effects on productivity and
      consequently, achieving economic-effective advances in food production
      efficiency. Particular attention is given to the potential genomic
      selection-derived results to facilitate precision management on modern dairy
      farms, including an overview of novel genome editing methodologies as
      perspectives toward the future.

TI  - Nutrition and Rheumatoid Arthritis in the 'Omics' Era.
LID - 763 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu13030763 [doi]
AB  - Modern high-throughput 'omics' science tools (including genomics,
      transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiomics) are currently being
      applied to nutritional sciences to unravel the fundamental processes of health
      effects ascribed to particular nutrients in humans and to contribute to more
      precise nutritional advice. Diet and food components are key environmental
      factors that interact with the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and
      the microbiota, and this life-long interplay defines health and diseases state of
      the individual. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease
      featured by a systemic immune-inflammatory response, in genetically susceptible
      individuals exposed to environmental triggers, including diet. In recent years
      increasing evidences suggested that nutritional factors and gut microbiome have a
      central role in RA risk and progression. The aim of this review is to summarize
      the main and most recent applications of 'omics' technologies in human nutrition 
      and in RA research, examining the possible influences of some nutrients and
      nutritional patterns on RA pathogenesis, following a nutrigenomics approach. The 
      opportunities and challenges of novel 'omics technologies' in the exploration of 
      new avenues in RA and nutritional research to prevent and manage RA will be also 
      discussed.

TI  - The genomics of ecological flexibility, large brains, and long lives in capuchin 
      monkeys revealed with fecalFACS.
LID - e2010632118 [pii]
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2010632118 [doi]
AB  - Ecological flexibility, extended lifespans, and large brains have long intrigued 
      evolutionary biologists, and comparative genomics offers an efficient and
      effective tool for generating new insights into the evolution of such traits.
      Studies of capuchin monkeys are particularly well situated to shed light on the
      selective pressures and genetic underpinnings of local adaptation to diverse
      habitats, longevity, and brain development. Distributed widely across Central and
      South America, they are inventive and extractive foragers, known for their
      sensorimotor intelligence. Capuchins have among the largest relative brain size
      of any monkey and a lifespan that exceeds 50 y, despite their small (3 to 5 kg)
      body size. We assemble and annotate a de novo reference genome for Cebus imitator
      Through high-depth sequencing of DNA derived from blood, various tissues, and
      feces via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (fecalFACS) to isolate monkey
      epithelial cells, we compared genomes of capuchin populations from tropical dry
      forests and lowland rainforests and identified population divergence in genes
      involved in water balance, kidney function, and metabolism. Through a comparative
      genomics approach spanning a wide diversity of mammals, we identified genes under
      positive selection associated with longevity and brain development. Additionally,
      we provide a technological advancement in the use of noninvasive genomics for
      studies of free-ranging mammals. Our intra- and interspecific comparative study
      of capuchin genomics provides insights into processes underlying local adaptation
      to diverse and physiologically challenging environments, as well as the molecular
      basis of brain evolution and longevity.

TI  - Genetic characterization of a mild isolate of papaya ringspot virus type-P
      (PRSV-P) and assessment of its cross-protection potential under greenhouse and
      field conditions.
PG  - e0241652
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0241652 [doi]
AB  - A mild isolate of Papaya ringspot virus type-P, abbreviated as PRSV-mild, from
      Ecuador was sequenced and characterized. The most distinguishing symptom induced 
      by PRSV-mild was gray powder-like leaf patches radiating from secondary veins. In
      greenhouse experiments, PRSV-mild did not confer durable protection against a
      severe isolate of the virus (PRSV-sev), obtained from the same field.
      Furthermore, isolate specific detection in mixed-infected plants showed that
      PRSV-sev becomes dominant in infections, rendering PRSV-mild undetectable at
      90-120 days post superinfection. Virus testing using isolate-specific primers
      detected PRSV-mild in two out of five surveyed provinces, with 10% and 48% of
      incidence in Santo Domingo and Los Rios, respectively. Comparative genomics
      showed that PRSV-mild lacks two amino acids from the coat protein region, whereas
      amino acid determinants for asymptomatic phenotypes were not identified.
      Recombination events were not predicted in the genomes of the Ecuadorean
      isolates. Phylogenetic analyses placed both PRSV-mild and PRSV-sev in a clade
      that includes an additional PRSV isolate from Ecuador and others from South
      America.

PG  - e1008678
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008678 [doi]
AB  - Mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to a single arbitrary reference
      genome is a frequently used approach in microbial genomics. However, the choice
      of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent
      analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
      phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice
      on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant
      bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens). Publicly available whole-genome 
      assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as
      reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination
      rates, dN/dS ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the
      mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an
      impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, 
      these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as
      including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic
      distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might
      introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses,
      particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In
      any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions 
      is highly recommended.

TI  - Host plants and Wolbachia shape the population genetics of sympatric herbivore
      populations.
PG  - 2740-2753
LID - 10.1111/eva.13079 [doi]
AB  - Changing climate and land-use practices have the potential to bring previously
      isolated populations of pest insects into new sympatry. This heightens the need
      to better understand how differing patterns of host-plant association, and unique
      endosymbionts, serve to promote genetic isolation or integration. We addressed
      these factors in populations of potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), a 
      generalist herbivore that vectors a bacterial pathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter
      solanacearum, causal pathogen of zebra chip disease) of potato (Solanum tuberosum
      L.). Genome-wide SNP data revealed two major genetic clusters-psyllids collected 
      from potato crops were genetically similar to psyllids found on a common weed,
      Lycium spp., but dissimilar from those found on another common non-crop host,
      Solanum dulcamara L. Most psyllids found on Lycium spp. and potato represented a 
      single mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) haplotype that has been suggested
      to not be native to the region, and whose arrival may have been concurrent with
      zebra chip disease first emerging. The putatively introduced COI haplotype
      usually co-occurred with endosymbiotic Wolbachia, while the putatively resident
      COI haplotype generally did not. Genetic intermediates between the two genetic
      populations of insects were rare, consistent with recent sympatry or reproductive
      isolation, although admixture patterns of apparent hybrids were consistent with
      introgression of genes from introduced into resident populations. Our results
      suggest that both host-plant associations and endosymbionts are shaping the
      population genetic structure of sympatric psyllid populations associated with
      different non-crop hosts. It is of future interest to explicitly examine
      vectorial capacity of the two populations and their potential hybrids, as
      population structure and hybridization might alter regional vector capacity and
      disease outbreaks.

LID - 10.3390/genes11101218 [doi]
AB  - Across the distribution of the Caspian whipsnake (Dolichophis caspius),
      populations have become increasingly disconnected due to habitat alteration. To
      understand population dynamics and this widespread but locally endangered snake's
      adaptive potential, we investigated population structure, admixture, and
      effective migration patterns. We took a landscape-genomic approach to identify
      selected genotypes associated with environmental variables relevant to D.
      caspius. With double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing of
      53 samples resulting in 17,518 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we
      identified 8 clusters within D. caspius reflecting complex evolutionary patterns 
      of the species. Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) revealed
      higher-than-average gene flow in most of the Balkan Peninsula and
      lower-than-average gene flow along the middle section of the Danube River.
      Landscape genomic analysis identified 751 selected genotypes correlated with 7
      climatic variables. Isothermality correlated with the highest number of selected 
      genotypes (478) located in 41 genes, followed by annual range (127) and annual
      mean temperature (87). We conclude that environmental variables, especially the
      day-to-night temperature oscillation in comparison to the summer-to-winter
      oscillation, may have an important role in the distribution and adaptation of D. 
      caspius.

TI  - Clinical, genomics and networking analyses of a high-altitude native American
      Ecuadorian patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis: a case 
      report.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s12920-020-00764-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is an
      extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insensitivity to
      pain, inability to sweat and intellectual disability. CIPA is caused by mutations
      in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene (NTRK1) that encodes the
      high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (NGF). CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we 
      present clinical and molecular findings in a 9-year-old girl with CIPA. The
      high-altitude indigenous Ecuadorian patient presented several health problems
      such as anhidrosis, bone fractures, self-mutilation, osteochondroma, intellectual
      disability and Riga-Fede disease. After the mutational analysis of NTRK1, the
      patient showed a clearly autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with the
      pathogenic mutation rs763758904 (Arg602*) and the second missense mutation
      rs80356677 (Asp674Tyr). Additionally, the genomic analysis showed 69 pathogenic
      and/or likely pathogenic variants in 46 genes possibly related to phenotypic
      heterogeneity, including the rs324420 variant in the FAAH gene. The gene ontology
      enrichment analysis showed 28 mutated genes involved in several biological
      processes. As a novel contribution, the protein-protein interaction network
      analysis showed that NTRK1, SPTBN2 and GRM6 interact with several proteins of the
      pain matrix involved in the response to stimulus and nervous system development. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that associates clinical, genomics and
      networking analyses in a Native American patient with consanguinity background in
      order to better understand CIPA pathogenesis.

AB  - Pantropical Bulbophyllum, with approximately 2,200 species, is one of the largest
      genera in Orchidaceae. Although phylogenetics and taxonomy of the approximately
      60 American species in the genus are generally well understood, some species
      complexes need more study to clearly delimit their component species and provide 
      information about their evolutionary history. Previous research has suggested
      that the plastid genome includes phylogenetic markers capable of providing
      resolution at low taxonomic levels, and thus it could be an effective tool if
      these divergent regions can be identified. In this study, we sequenced the
      complete plastid genome of eight Bulbophyllum species, representing five of six
      Neotropical taxonomic sections. All plastomes conserve the typical quadripartite 
      structure, and, although the general structure of plastid genomes is conserved,
      differences in ndh-gene composition and total length were detected. Total length 
      was determined by contraction and expansion of the small single-copy region, a
      result of an independent loss of the seven ndh genes. Selection analyses
      indicated that protein-coding genes were generally well conserved, but in four
      genes, we identified 95 putative sites under positive selection. Furthermore, a
      total of 54 polymorphic simple sequence repeats were identified, for which we
      developed amplification primers. In addition, we propose 10 regions with
      potential to improve phylogenetic analyses of Neotropical Bulbophyllum species.

TI  - Natural Defect of a Plant Rhabdovirus Glycoprotein Gene: A Case Study of
      Virus-Plant Coevolution.
PG  - 227-236
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-05-20-0191-FI [doi]
AB  - Seven isolates of a putative cytorhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae, order
      Mononegavirales) designated as citrus-associated rhabdovirus (CiaRV) were
      identified in citrus, passion fruit, and paper bush from the same geographical
      area in China. CiaRV, bean-associated cytorhabdovirus (Brazil), and papaya virus 
      E (Ecuador) should be taxonomically classified in the species Papaya
      cytorhabdovirus. Due to natural mutations, the glycoprotein (G) and P4 genes were
      impaired in citrus-infecting isolates of CiaRV, resulting in an atypical
      rhabdovirus genome organization of 3' leader-N-P-P3-M-L-5' trailer. The P3
      protein of CiaRV shared a common origin with begomoviral movement proteins
      (family Geminiviridae). Secondary structure analysis and trans-complementation of
      movement-deficient tomato mosaic virus and potato virus X mutants by CiaRV P3
      supported its function in viral cell-to-cell trafficking. The wide geographical
      dispersal of CiaRV and related viruses suggests an efficient transmission
      mechanism, as well as an underlying risk to global agriculture. Both the natural 
      phenomenon and experimental analyses demonstrated presence of the "degraded" type
      of CiaRV in citrus, in parallel to "undegraded" types in other host plant
      species. This case study shows a plant virus losing the function of an important 
      but nonessential gene, likely due to host shift and adaption, which deepened our 
      understanding of course of natural viral diversification.

AB  - General consensus emphasizes that no single biological process can explain the
      patterns of species' distributions and diversification in the Neotropics.
      Instead, the interplay of several processes across space and time must be taken
      into account. Here we investigated the phylogenetic relationships and
      biogeographic history of tree frogs in the Dendropsophus leucophyllatus species
      group (Amphibia: Hylidae), which is distributed across Amazonia and the Atlantic 
      rainforests. Using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and double digest
      restriction-site associated DNA (ddRADseq), we inferred phylogenetic
      relationships, species limits, and temporal and geographic patterns of
      diversification relative to the history of these biomes. Our results indicate
      that the D. leucophyllatus species group includes at least 14 independent
      lineages, which are currently arranged into ten described species. Therefore, a
      significant portion of species in the group are still unnamed. Different
      processes were associated to the group diversification history. For instance, the
      Andes uplift likely caused allopatric speciation for Cis-Andean species, whereas 
      it may also be responsible for changes in the Amazonian landscape triggering
      parapatric speciation by local adaptation to ecological factors. Meanwhile,
      Atlantic Forest ancestors unable to cross the dry diagonal biomes after
      rainforest's retraction, evolved in isolation into different species.
      Diversification in the group began in the early Miocene, when connections between
      Atlantic Forest and the Andes (Pacific Dominion) by way of a south corridor were 
      possible. The historical scenario in Amazonia, characterized by several
      speciation events and habitat heterogeneity, helped promoting diversification,
      resulting in the highest species diversity for the group. This marked species
      diversification did not happen in Atlantic Forest, where speciation is very
      recent (late Pliocene and Pleistocene), despite its remarkable climatic
      heterogeneity.

AB  - A collection of 163 accessions, including Solanum pimpinellifolium, Solanum
      lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and Solanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum, was
      selected to represent the genetic and morphological variability of tomato at its 
      centers of origin and domestication: Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador and
      Mesoamerica. The collection is enriched with S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme
      from the Amazonian region that has not been analyzed previously nor used
      extensively. The collection has been morphologically characterized showing
      diversity for fruit, flower and vegetative traits. Their genomes were sequenced
      in the Varitome project and are publicly available
      (solgenomics.net/projects/varitome). The identified SNPs have been annotated with
      respect to their impact and a total number of 37,974 out of 19,364,146 SNPs have 
      been described as high impact by the SnpEeff analysis. GWAS has shown
      associations for different traits, demonstrating the potential of this collection
      for this kind of analysis. We have not only identified known QTLs and genes, but 
      also new regions associated with traits such as fruit color, number of flowers
      per inflorescence or inflorescence architecture. To speed up and facilitate the
      use of this information, F2 populations were constructed by crossing the whole
      collection with three different parents. This F2 collection is useful for testing
      SNPs identified by GWAs, selection sweeps or any other candidate gene. All data
      is available on Solanaceae Genomics Network and the accession and F2 seeds are
      freely available at COMAV and at TGRC genebanks. All these resources together
      make this collection a good candidate for genetic studies.

TI  - Phylogenomics Reveals Ancient Gene Tree Discordance in the Amphibian Tree of
      Life.
PG  - 49-66
LID - 10.1093/sysbio/syaa034 [doi]
AB  - Molecular phylogenies have yielded strong support for many parts of the amphibian
      Tree of Life, but poor support for the resolution of deeper nodes, including
      relationships among families and orders. To clarify these relationships, we
      provide a phylogenomic perspective on amphibian relationships by developing a
      taxon-specific Anchored Hybrid Enrichment protocol targeting hundreds of
      conserved exons which are effective across the class. After obtaining data from
      220 loci for 286 species (representing 94% of the families and 44% of the
      genera), we estimate a phylogeny for extant amphibians and identify gene
      tree-species tree conflict across the deepest branches of the amphibian
      phylogeny. We perform locus-by-locus genealogical interrogation of alternative
      topological hypotheses for amphibian monophyly, focusing on interordinal
      relationships. We find that phylogenetic signal deep in the amphibian phylogeny
      varies greatly across loci in a manner that is consistent with incomplete lineage
      sorting in the ancestral lineage of extant amphibians. Our results overwhelmingly
      support amphibian monophyly and a sister relationship between frogs and
      salamanders, consistent with the Batrachia hypothesis. Species tree analyses
      converge on a small set of topological hypotheses for the relationships among
      extant amphibian families. These results clarify several contentious portions of 
      the amphibian Tree of Life, which in conjunction with a set of vetted fossil
      calibrations, support a surprisingly younger timescale for crown and ordinal
      amphibian diversification than previously reported. More broadly, our study
      provides insight into the sources, magnitudes, and heterogeneity of support
      across loci in phylogenomic data sets.[AIC; Amphibia; Batrachia; Phylogeny; gene 
      tree-species tree discordance; genomics; information theory.].

AB  - Gene flow is an enigmatic evolutionary force because it can limit adaptation but 
      may also rescue small populations from inbreeding depression [1-3]. Several
      iconic examples of genetic rescue-increased population growth caused by gene flow
      [4, 5]-have reversed population declines [6, 7]. However, concerns about
      outbreeding depression and maladaptive gene flow limit the use of human-mediated 
      gene flow in conservation [8, 9]. Rescue effects of immigration through
      demographic and/or genetic mechanisms have received theoretical and empirical
      support, but studies that monitor initial and long-term effects of gene flow on
      individuals and populations in the wild are lacking. Here, we used
      individual-based mark-recapture, multigenerational pedigrees, and genomics to
      test the demographic and evolutionary consequences of manipulating gene flow in
      two isolated, wild Trinidadian guppy populations. Recipient and source
      populations originated from environments with different predation, flow, and
      resource regimes [10]. We documented 10-fold increases in population size
      following gene flow and found that, on average, hybrids lived longer and
      reproduced more than residents and immigrants. Despite overall genomic
      homogenization, alleles potentially associated with local adaptation were not
      entirely swamped by gene flow. Our results suggest that genetic rescue was caused
      not just by increasing individual genetic diversity, rather new genomic variation
      from immigrants combined with alleles from the recipient population resulted in
      highly fit hybrids and subsequent increases in population size. Contrary to the
      classic view of maladaptive gene flow, our study reveals conditions under which
      immigration can produce long-term fitness benefits in small populations without
      entirely swamping adaptive variation.

TI  - Human genetics and genomics research in Ecuador: historical survey, current

AB  - BACKGROUND: In South America, the history of human genetics is extensive and its 
      beginnings go back to the onset of the twentieth century. In Ecuador, the
      historical record of human genetics and genomics research is limited. In this
      context, our work analyzes the current status and historical panorama of these
      fields, based on bibliographic searches in Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and
      Web of Science. RESULTS: Our results determined that the oldest paper in human
      genetics coauthored by an Ecuadorian institution originates from the Central
      University of Ecuador in 1978. From a historical standpoint, the number of
      articles has increased since the 1990s. This growth has intensified and it is
      reflected in 137 manuscripts recorded from 2010 to 2019. Areas such as human
      population genetics, phylogeography, and forensic sciences are the core of
      genetics and genomics-associated research in Ecuador. Important advances have
      been made in the understanding of the bases of cancer, some genetic diseases, and
      congenital disorders. Fields such as pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics have
      begun to be explored during the last years. CONCLUSIONS: This work paints a
      comprehensive picture and provides additional insights into the future panorama
      of human genetic and genomic research in Ecuador as an example of an emerging,
      resource-limited country with interesting phylogeographic characteristics and
      public health implications.

TI  - Targeted exon sequencing in deceased schizophrenia patients in Denmark.
PG  - 135-147
LID - 10.1007/s00414-019-02212-z [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia patients have higher mortality rates and lower life expectancy than
      the general population. However, forensic investigations of their deaths often
      fail to determine the cause of death, hindering prevention. As schizophrenia is a
      highly heritable condition and given recent advances in our understanding of the 
      genetics of schizophrenia, it is now possible to investigate how genetic factors 
      may contribute to mortality. We made use of findings from genome-wide association
      studies (GWAS) to design a targeted panel (PsychPlex) for sequencing of exons of 
      451 genes near index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified with GWAS.
      We sequenced the DNA of 95 deceased schizophrenia patients included in SURVIVE, a
      prospective, autopsy-based study of mentally ill persons in Denmark. We compared 
      the allele frequencies of 1039 SNPs in these cases with the frequencies of 2000
      Danes without psychiatric diseases and calculated their deleteriousness (CADD)
      scores. For 81 SNPs highly associated with schizophrenia and CADD scores above
      15, expression profiles in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project
      indicated that these variants were in exons, whose expressions are increased in
      several types of brain tissues, particularly in the cerebellum. Molecular pathway
      analysis indicated the involvement of 163 different pathways. As for rare SNP
      variants, most variants were scored as either benign or likely benign with an
      average of 17 variants of unknown significance per individual and no pathogenic
      variant. Our results highlight the potential of DNA sequencing of an exon panel
      to discover genetic factors that may be involved in the development of
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Alternative Oxidase (AOX) Senses Stress Levels to Coordinate Auxin-Induced
      Reprogramming From Seed Germination to Somatic Embryogenesis-A Role Relevant for 
      Seed Vigor Prediction and Plant Robustness.
PG  - 1134
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2019.01134 [doi]
AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the most striking and prominent example of plant
      plasticity upon severe stress. Inducing immature carrot seeds perform SE as
      substitute to germination by auxin treatment can be seen as switch between stress
      levels associated to morphophysiological plasticity. This experimental system is 
      highly powerful to explore stress response factors that mediate the metabolic
      switch between cell and tissue identities. Developmental plasticity per se is an 
      emerging trait for in vitro systems and crop improvement. It is supposed to
      underlie multi-stress tolerance. High plasticity can protect plants throughout
      life cycles against variable abiotic and biotic conditions. We provide proof of
      concepts for the existing hypothesis that alternative oxidase (AOX) can be
      relevant for developmental plasticity and be associated to yield stability. Our
      perspective on AOX as relevant coordinator of cell reprogramming is supported by 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses and gross metabolism data from
      calorespirometry complemented by SHAM-inhibitor studies on primed, elevated
      partial pressure of oxygen (EPPO)-stressed, and endophyte-treated seeds. In
      silico studies on public experimental data from diverse species strengthen
      generality of our insights. Finally, we highlight ready-to-use concepts for plant
      selection and optimizing in vivo and in vitro propagation that do not require
      further details on molecular physiology and metabolism. This is demonstrated by
      applying our research & technology concepts to pea genotypes with differential
      yield performance in multilocation fields and chickpea types known for
      differential robustness in the field. By using these concepts and tools
      appropriately, also other marker candidates than AOX and complex genomics data
      can be efficiently validated for prebreeding and seed vigor prediction.

TI  - Phylogeography of a cryptic speciation continuum in Eurasian spadefoot toads
      (Pelobates).
PG  - 3257-3270
LID - 10.1111/mec.15133 [doi]
AB  - Cryptic phylogeographic diversifications provide unique models to examine the
      role of phylogenetic divergence on the evolution of reproductive isolation,
      without extrinsic factors such as ecological and behavioural differentiation.
      Yet, to date very few comparative studies have been attempted within such
      radiations. Here, we characterize a new speciation continuum in a group of
      widespread Eurasian amphibians, the Pelobates spadefoot toads, by conducting
      multilocus (restriction site associated DNA sequencing and mitochondrial DNA)
      phylogenetic, phylogeographic and hybrid zone analyses. Within the P. syriacus
      complex, we discovered species-level cryptic divergences (>5 million years ago
      [My]) between populations distributed in the Near-East (hereafter P. syriacus
      sensu stricto [s.s.]) and southeastern Europe (hereafter P. balcanicus), each
      featuring deep intraspecific lineages. Altogether, we could scale hybridizability
      to divergence time along six different stages, spanning from sympatry without
      gene flow (P. fuscus and P. balcanicus, >10 My), parapatry with highly restricted
      hybridization (P. balcanicus and P. syriacus s.s., >5 My), narrow hybrid zones
      (~15 km) consistent with partial reproductive isolation (P. fuscus and P.
      vespertinus, ~3 My), to extensive admixture between Pleistocene and refugial
      lineages (</=2 My). This full spectrum empirically supports a gradual build up of
      reproductive barriers through time, reversible up until a threshold that we
      estimate at ~3 My. Hence, cryptic phylogeographic lineages may fade away or
      become reproductively isolated species simply depending on the time they persist 
      in allopatry, and without definite ecomorphological divergence.

AB  - Current rates of biodiversity loss pose an unprecedented challenge to the
      conservation community, particularly with amphibians and freshwater fish as the
      most threatened vertebrates. An increasing number of environmental challenges,
      including habitat loss, pathogens, and global warming, demand a global response
      toward the sustainable management of ecosystems and their biodiversity.
      Conservation Breeding Programs (CBPs) are needed for the sustainable management
      of amphibian species threatened with extinction. CBPs support species survival
      while increasing public awareness and political influence. Current CBPs only
      cater for 10% of the almost 500 amphibian species in need. However, the use of
      sperm storage to increase efficiency and reliability, along with an increased
      number of CBPs, offer the potential to significantly reduce species loss. The
      establishment and refinement of techniques over the last two decades, for the
      collection and storage of amphibian spermatozoa, gives confidence for their use
      in CBPs and other biotechnical applications. Cryopreserved spermatozoa has
      produced breeding pairs of frogs and salamanders and the stage is set for
      Lifecycle Proof of Concept Programs that use cryopreserved sperm in CBPs along
      with repopulation, supplementation, and translocation programs. The application
      of cryopreserved sperm in CBPs, is complimentary to but separate from archival
      gene banking and general cell and tissue storage. However, where appropriate
      amphibian sperm banking should be integrated into other global biobanking
      projects, especially those for fish, and those that include the use of
      cryopreserved material for genomics and other research. Research over a broader
      range of amphibian species, and more uniformity in experimental methodology, is
      needed to inform both theory and application. Genomics is revolutionising our
      understanding of biological processes and increasingly guiding species
      conservation through the identification of evolutionary significant units as the 
      conservation focus, and through revealing the intimate relationship between
      evolutionary history and sperm physiology that ultimately affects the amenability
      of sperm to refrigerated or frozen storage. In the present review we provide a
      nascent phylogenetic framework for integration with other research lines to
      further the potential of amphibian sperm banking.

PG  - 20180249
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2018.0249 [doi]
AB  - Animal microbiomes play an important role in dietary adaptation, yet the extent
      to which microbiome changes exhibit parallel evolution is unclear. Of particular 
      interest is an adaptation to extreme diets, such as blood, which poses special
      challenges in its content of proteins and lack of essential nutrients. In this
      study, we assessed taxonomic signatures (by 16S rRNA amplicon profiling) and
      potential functional signatures (inferred by Phylogenetic Investigation of
      Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt)) of haematophagy in 
      birds and bats. Our goal was to test three alternative hypotheses: no convergence
      of microbiomes, convergence in taxonomy and convergence in function. We find a
      statistically significant effect of haematophagy in terms of microbial taxonomic 
      convergence across the blood-feeding bats and birds, although this effect is
      small compared to the differences found between haematophagous and
      non-haematophagous species within the two host clades. We also find some evidence
      of convergence at the predicted functional level, although it is possible that
      the lack of metagenomic data and the poor representation of microbial lineages
      adapted to haematophagy in genome databases limit the power of this approach. The
      results provide a paradigm for exploring convergent microbiome evolution
      replicated with independent contrasts in different host lineages. This article is
      part of the theme issue 'Convergent evolution in the genomics era: new insights
      and directions'.

TI  - The Expectations and Challenges of Wildlife Disease Research in the Era of
      Genomics: Forecasting with a Horizon Scan-like Exercise.
PG  - 261-274
LID - 10.1093/jhered/esz001 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak and transmission of disease-causing pathogens are contributing to
      the unprecedented rate of biodiversity decline. Recent advances in genomics have 
      coalesced into powerful tools to monitor, detect, and reconstruct the role of
      pathogens impacting wildlife populations. Wildlife researchers are thus uniquely 
      positioned to merge ecological and evolutionary studies with genomic technologies
      to exploit unprecedented "Big Data" tools in disease research; however, many
      researchers lack the training and expertise required to use these computationally
      intensive methodologies. To address this disparity, the inaugural "Genomics of
      Disease in Wildlife" workshop assembled early to mid-career professionals with
      expertise across scientific disciplines (e.g., genomics, wildlife biology,
      veterinary sciences, and conservation management) for training in the application
      of genomic tools to wildlife disease research. A horizon scanning-like exercise, 
      an activity to identify forthcoming trends and challenges, performed by the
      workshop participants identified and discussed 5 themes considered to be the most
      pressing to the application of genomics in wildlife disease research: 1)
      "Improving communication," 2) "Methodological and analytical advancements," 3)
      "Translation into practice," 4) "Integrating landscape ecology and genomics," and
      5) "Emerging new questions." Wide-ranging solutions from the horizon scan were
      international in scope, itemized both deficiencies and strengths in wildlife
      genomic initiatives, promoted the use of genomic technologies to unite wildlife
      and human disease research, and advocated best practices for optimal use of
      genomic tools in wildlife disease projects. The results offer a glimpse of the
      potential revolution in human and wildlife disease research possible through
      multi-disciplinary collaborations at local, regional, and global scales.

AB  - The organisms of the Galapagos Islands played a central role in the development
      of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin. Examination of the population
      genetics factors of many of these organisms with modern molecular methods has
      expanded our understanding of their evolution. Here, I provide a perspective on
      how selection, gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, and inbreeding have
      contributed to the evolution of 6 iconic Galapagos species: flightless cormorant,
      pink iguana, marine iguana, Galapagos hawk, giant tortoises, and Darwin's
      finches. Because of the inherent biological differences among these species that 
      have colonized the Galapagos, different population genetic factors appear to be
      more or less important in these different species. For example, the Galapagos
      provided novel environments in which strong selection took place and the Darwin's
      finches diversified to produce new species and the cormorant adapted to the
      nutrient-rich western shores of the Galapagos by losing its ability to fly and
      genomic data have now identified candidate genes. In both the pink iguana, which 
      exists in one small population, and the Galapagos hawk, which has small
      population sizes, genetic drift has been potentially quite important. There
      appears to be very limited interisland gene flow in the flightless cormorant and 
      the Galapagos hawk. On the other hand, both the marine iguana and some of the
      Darwin's finches appear to have significant interisland gene flow. Hybridization 
      between species and subspecies has also introduced new adaptive variation, and in
      some cases, hybridization might have resulted in despeciation. Overall, new
      population genetics and genomics research has provided additional insight into
      the evolution of vertebrate species in the Galapagos.

TI  - Population genomics through time provides insights into the consequences of
      decline and rapid demographic recovery through head-starting in a Galapagos giant
      tortoise.
PG  - 1811-1821

AB  - Population genetic theory related to the consequences of rapid population decline
      is well-developed, but there are very few empirical studies where sampling was
      conducted before and after a known bottleneck event. Such knowledge is of
      particular importance for species restoration, given links between genetic
      diversity and the probability of long-term persistence. To directly evaluate the 
      relationship between current genetic diversity and past demographic events, we
      collected genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from prebottleneck
      historical (c.1906) and postbottleneck contemporary (c.2014) samples of Pinzon
      giant tortoises (Chelonoidis duncanensis; n = 25 and 149 individuals,
      respectively) endemic to a single island in the Galapagos. Pinzon giant tortoises
      had a historically large population size that was reduced to just 150-200
      individuals in the mid 20th century. Since then, Pinzon's tortoise population has
      recovered through an ex situ head-start programme in which eggs or pre-emergent
      individuals were collected from natural nests on the island, reared ex situ in
      captivity until they were 4-5 years old and subsequently repatriated. We found
      that the extent and distribution of genetic variation in the historical and
      contemporary samples were very similar, with the latter group not exhibiting the 
      characteristic genetic patterns of recent population decline. No population
      structure was detected either spatially or temporally. We estimated an effective 
      population size (N e) of 58 (95% CI = 50-69) for the postbottleneck population;
      no prebottleneck N e point estimate was attainable (95% CI = 39-infinity) likely 
      due to the sample size being lower than the true N e. Overall, the historical
      sample provided a valuable benchmark for evaluating the head-start captive
      breeding programme, revealing high retention of genetic variation and no skew in 
      representation despite the documented bottleneck event. Moreover, this work
      demonstrates the effectiveness of head-starting in rescuing the Pinzon giant
      tortoise from almost certain extinction.

TI  - Species Limits and Phylogenomic Relationships of Darwin's Finches Remain
      Unresolved: Potential Consequences of a Volatile Ecological Setting.
PG  - 347-357
LID - 10.1093/sysbio/syy073 [doi]
AB  - Island biotas have become paradigms for illustrating many evolutionary processes.
      The fauna of the Galapagos Islands includes several taxa that have been focal
      points for evolutionary studies. Perhaps their most famous inhabitants, Darwin's 
      finches, represent a go-to icon when thinking about how species originate and
      adapt to the environment. However, unlike other adaptive radiations, past
      morphological and molecular studies of Darwin's finches have yielded inconsistent
      hypotheses of species limits and phylogenetic relationships. Expecting that
      idiosyncrasies of prior data and analytic methods explained different proposed
      classifications, we were surprised to observe that three new phylogenetic
      hypotheses derived mostly from the same genomics data were topologically
      inconsistent. We found that the differences between some of these genomics trees 
      were as great as one would expect between two random trees with the same number
      of taxa. Thus, the phylogeny of Darwin's finches remains unresolved, as it has
      for more than a century. A component of phylogenetic uncertainty comes from
      unclear species limits, under any species concept, in the ground finches
      (Geospiza) and tree finches (Camarhynchus). We suggest that past authors should
      have tested the species limits of Lack, rather than uncritically accepting them. 
      In fact, the impressive amount of genomics data do not provide unambiguous
      hypotheses of the number of species of Geospiza or Camarhynchus, although they
      imply greater species diversity than Lack's taxonomy. We suggest that
      insufficient sampling of species populations across islands (35.6% for
      morphometrics and 20.4% for genomics) prevents accurate diagnoses of species
      limits. However, it is unknown whether samples from a greater number of islands
      might result in bridging differences between species, or reveal many new ones. We
      conclude that attempts to interpret patterns of variation among the finches under
      standard evolutionary paradigms have obscured some major messages, most
      specifically the ongoing reciprocal interactions between geographic isolation and
      lineage divergence, and dispersal and gene flow caused by the volatile ecological
      conditions in the islands. Although the finches provide textbook examples of
      natural selection, better understanding of species limits and a robust
      phylogenetic hypothesis are required to corroborate past hypotheses of speciation
      and adaptive radiation in the finches of the Galapagos.

      Research Studies.
PG  - 13978

AB  - Over the past decades, consistent studies have shown that race/ethnicity have a
      great impact on cancer incidence, survival, drug response, molecular pathways and
      epigenetics. Despite the influence of race/ethnicity in cancer outcomes and its
      impact in health care quality, a comprehensive understanding of racial/ethnic
      inclusion in oncological research has never been addressed. We therefore explored
      the racial/ethnic composition of samples/individuals included in fundamental
      (patient-derived oncological models, biobanks and genomics) and applied cancer
      research studies (clinical trials). Regarding patient-derived oncological models 
      (n = 794), 48.3% have no records on their donor's race/ethnicity, the rest were
      isolated from White (37.5%), Asian (10%), African American (3.8%) and Hispanic
      (0.4%) donors. Biobanks (n = 8,293) hold specimens from unknown (24.56%), White
      (59.03%), African American (11.05%), Asian (4.12%) and other individuals (1.24%).
      Genomic projects (n = 6,765,447) include samples from unknown (0.6%), White
      (91.1%), Asian (5.6%), African American (1.7%), Hispanic (0.5%) and other
      populations (0.5%). Concerning clinical trials (n = 89,212), no racial/ethnic
      registries were found in 66.95% of participants, and records were mainly obtained
      from Whites (25.94%), Asians (4.97%), African Americans (1.08%), Hispanics
      (0.16%) and other minorities (0.9%). Thus, two tendencies were observed across
      oncological studies: lack of racial/ethnic information and overrepresentation of 
      Caucasian/White samples/individuals. These results clearly indicate a need to
      diversify oncological studies to other populations along with novel strategies to
      enhanced race/ethnicity data recording and reporting.

AB  - In the last few decades, genomic manipulation has made significant progress as a 
      result of the development of recombinant DNA technologies; however, more often
      than not, these techniques have been costly and labor intensive. In contrast,
      recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided a 
      cheaper, faster, and easier process to study genomics. In particular, an NGS
      technique emerged from bacterial CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) as a
      revolutionary method to modify, regulate, or mark specific genomic sequences on
      virtually any organism. A later adaptation of this bacterial defense mechanism
      that successfully and permanently edits dysfunctional genes and corrects missing 
      proteins has resulted in a new era for disease genetic engineering. Clinical
      trials using this technique are already being performed, and the applicability of
      CRISPR-Cas9 techniques is actively being investigated using in vivo studies.
      However, the concept of genome correction poses great concerns from a regulatory 
      perspective, especially in terms of security, so principles for the regulation of
      these methodologies are being established. We delved into CRISPR-Cas9 from its
      natural and ortholog origins to its engineered variants and behaviors to present 
      its notable and diverse applications in the fields of biotechnology and human
      therapeutics.

TI  - Radiation of the polymorphic Little Devil poison frog (Oophaga sylvatica) in
      Ecuador.
PG  - 9750-9762
LID - 10.1002/ece3.3503 [doi]
AB  - Some South American poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are chemically defended and use 
      bright aposematic colors to warn potential predators of their unpalatability.
      Aposematic signals are often frequency-dependent where individuals deviating from
      a local model are at a higher risk of predation. However, extreme diversity in
      the aposematic signal has been documented in poison frogs, especially in Oophaga.
      Here, we explore the phylogeographic pattern among color-divergent populations of
      the Little Devil poison frog Oophaga sylvatica by analyzing population structure 
      and genetic differentiation to evaluate which processes could account for color
      diversity within and among populations. With a combination of PCR amplicons
      (three mitochondrial and three nuclear markers) and genome-wide markers from a
      double-digested RAD (ddRAD) approach, we characterized the phylogenetic and
      genetic structure of 199 individuals from 13 populations (12 monomorphic and 1
      polymorphic) across the O. sylvatica distribution. Individuals segregated into
      two main lineages by their northern or southern latitudinal distribution. A high 
      level of genetic and phenotypic polymorphism within the northern lineage suggests
      ongoing gene flow. In contrast, low levels of genetic differentiation were
      detected among the southern lineage populations and support recent range
      expansions from populations in the northern lineage. We propose that a
      combination of climatic gradients and structured landscapes might be promoting
      gene flow and phylogenetic diversification. Alternatively, we cannot rule out
      that the observed phenotypic and genomic variations are the result of genetic
      drift on near or neutral alleles in a small number of genes.

TI  - Genomic Medicine Without Borders: Which Strategies Should Developing Countries
      Employ to Invest in Precision Medicine? A New "Fast-Second Winner" Strategy.
PG  - 647-657
LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0141 [doi]
AB  - Genomic medicine has greatly matured in terms of its technical capabilities, but 
      the diffusion of genomic innovations worldwide faces significant barriers beyond 
      mere access to technology. New global development strategies are sorely needed
      for biotechnologies such as genomics and their applications toward precision
      medicine without borders. Moreover, diffusion of genomic medicine globally cannot
      adhere to a "one-size-fits-all-countries" development strategy, in the same way
      that drug treatments should be customized. This begs a timely, difficult but
      crucial question: How should developing countries, and the resource-limited
      regions of developed countries, invest in genomic medicine? Although a full-scale
      investment in infrastructure from discovery to the translational implementation
      of genomic science is ideal, this may not always be feasible in all countries at 
      all times. A simple "transplantation of genomics" from developed to developing
      countries is unlikely to be feasible. Nor should developing countries be seen as 
      simple recipients and beneficiaries of genomic medicine developed elsewhere
      because important advances in genomic medicine have materialized in developing
      countries as well. There are several noteworthy examples of genomic medicine
      success stories involving resource-limited settings that are contextualized and
      described in this global genomic medicine innovation analysis. In addition, we
      outline here a new long-term development strategy for global genomic medicine in 
      a way that recognizes the individual country's pressing public health priorities 
      and disease burdens. We term this approach the "Fast-Second Winner" model of
      innovation that supports innovation commencing not only "upstream" of discovery
      science but also "mid-stream," building on emerging highly promising biomarker
      and diagnostic candidates from the global science discovery pipeline, based on
      the unique needs of each country. A mid-stream entry into innovation can enhance 
      collective learning from other innovators' mistakes upstream in discovery science
      and boost the probability of success for translation and implementation when
      resources are limited. This a la carte model of global innovation and development
      strategy offers multiple entry points into the global genomics innovation
      ecosystem for developing countries, whether or not extensive and expensive
      discovery infrastructures are already in place. Ultimately, broadening our
      thinking beyond the linear model of innovation will help us to enable the vision 
      and practice of genomics without borders in both developed and resource-limited
      settings.

TI  - Deciphering the Theobroma cacao self-incompatibility system: from genomics to
      diagnostic markers for self-compatibility.
PG  - 4775-4790
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erx293 [doi]
AB  - Cocoa self-compatibility is an important yield factor and has been described as
      being controlled by a late gameto-sporophytic system expressed only at the level 
      of the embryo sac. It results in gametic non-fusion and involves several loci. In
      this work, we identified two loci, located on chromosomes 1 and 4 (CH1 and CH4), 
      involved in cocoa self-incompatibility by two different processes. Both loci are 
      responsible for gametic selection, but only one (the CH4 locus) is involved in
      the main fruit drop. The CH1 locus acts prior to the gamete fusion step and
      independently of the CH4 locus. Using fine-mapping and genome-wide association
      studies, we focused analyses on restricted regions and identified candidate
      genes. Some of them showed a differential expression between incompatible and
      compatible reactions. Immunolocalization experiments provided evidence of CH1
      candidate genes expressed in ovule and style tissues. Highly polymorphic simple
      sequence repeat (SSR) diagnostic markers were designed in the CH4 region that had
      been identified by fine-mapping. They are characterized by a strong linkage
      disequilibrium with incompatibility alleles, thus allowing the development of
      efficient diagnostic markers predicting self-compatibility and fruit setting
      according to the presence of specific alleles or genotypes. SSR alleles specific 
      to self-compatible Amelonado and Criollo varieties were also identified, thus
      allowing screening for self-compatible plants in cocoa populations.

      cormorant.

LID - 10.1126/science.aal3345 [doi]
AB  - We have a limited understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of
      evolutionary changes in the size and proportion of limbs. We studied wing and
      pectoral skeleton reduction leading to flightlessness in the Galapagos cormorant 
      (Phalacrocorax harrisi). We sequenced and de novo assembled the genomes of four
      cormorant species and applied a predictive and comparative genomics approach to
      find candidate variants that may have contributed to the evolution of
      flightlessness. These analyses and cross-species experiments in Caenorhabditis
      elegans and in chondrogenic cell lines implicated variants in genes necessary for
      transcriptional regulation and function of the primary cilium. Cilia are
      essential for Hedgehog signaling, and humans affected by skeletal ciliopathies
      suffer from premature bone growth arrest, mirroring skeletal features associated 
      with loss of flight.

TI  - The adaptive genomic landscape of beak morphology in Darwin's finches.
PG  - 4978-4989
LID - 10.1111/mec.14166 [doi]
AB  - Beak shape in Darwin's ground finches (Geospiza) is emblematic of natural
      selection and adaptive radiation, yet our understanding of the genetic basis of
      beak shape variation, and thus the genetic target of natural selection, is still 
      evolving. Here we reveal the genomic architecture of beak shape variation using
      genomewide comparisons of four closely related and hybridizing species across 13 
      islands subject to parallel natural selection. Pairwise contrasts among species
      were used to identify a large number of genomic loci that are consistently
      related to species differences across a complex landscape. These loci are
      associated with hundreds of genes that have enriched GO categories significantly 
      associated with development. One genomic region of particular interest is a
      section of Chromosome 1A with many candidate genes and increased linkage. The
      distinct, pointed beak shape of the cactus finch is linked to an excess of
      intermediate frequency alleles and increased heterozygosity in significant SNPs, 
      but not across the rest of the genome. Alleles associated with pointier beaks
      among species were associated with pointier-beaked populations within each
      species, thus establishing a common basis for natural selection, species
      divergence and adaptive radiation. The adaptive genomic landscape for Darwin's
      finches mirrors theoretical expectations based on morphological variation. The
      implication that a large number of genes are actively maintained to facilitate
      beak variation across parallel populations with documented interspecies admixture
      challenges our understanding of evolutionary processes in the wild.

TI  - Gene flow, ancient polymorphism, and ecological adaptation shape the genomic
      landscape of divergence among Darwin's finches.
PG  - 1004-1015
LID - 10.1101/gr.212522.116 [doi]
AB  - Genomic comparisons of closely related species have identified "islands" of
      locally elevated sequence divergence. Genomic islands may contain functional
      variants involved in local adaptation or reproductive isolation and may therefore
      play an important role in the speciation process. However, genomic islands can
      also arise through evolutionary processes unrelated to speciation, and
      examination of their properties can illuminate how new species evolve. Here, we
      performed scans for regions of high relative divergence (FST) in 12 species pairs
      of Darwin's finches at different genetic distances. In each pair, we identify
      genomic islands that are, on average, elevated in both relative divergence (FST) 
      and absolute divergence (dXY). This signal indicates that haplotypes within these
      genomic regions became isolated from each other earlier than the rest of the
      genome. Interestingly, similar numbers of genomic islands of elevated dXY are
      observed in sympatric and allopatric species pairs, suggesting that recent gene
      flow is not a major factor in their formation. We find that two of the most
      pronounced genomic islands contain the ALX1 and HMGA2 loci, which are associated 
      with variation in beak shape and size, respectively, suggesting that they are
      involved in ecological adaptation. A subset of genomic island regions, including 
      these loci, appears to represent anciently diverged haplotypes that evolved early
      during the radiation of Darwin's finches. Comparative genomics data indicate that
      these loci, and genomic islands in general, have exceptionally low recombination 
      rates, which may play a role in their establishment.

AB  - Substantial heterogeneity exists in the dispersal, distribution and transmission 
      of parasitic species. Understanding and predicting how such features are governed
      by the ecological variation of landscape they inhabit is the central goal of
      spatial epidemiology. Genetic data can further inform functional connectivity
      among parasite, host and vector populations in a landscape. Gene flow correlates 
      with the spread of epidemiologically relevant phenotypes among parasite and
      vector populations (e.g., virulence, drug and pesticide resistance), as well as
      invasion and re-invasion risk where parasite transmission is absent due to
      current or past intervention measures. However, the formal integration of spatial
      and genetic data ('landscape genetics') is scarcely ever applied to parasites.
      Here, we discuss the specific challenges and practical prospects for the use of
      landscape genetics and genomics to understand the biology and control of
      parasitic disease and present a practical framework for doing so.

LID - e14552 [pii]
AB  - Canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT) is a clonally transmissible cancer
      that originated approximately 11,000 years ago and affects dogs worldwide.
      Despite the clonal origin of the CTVT nuclear genome, CTVT mitochondrial genomes 
      (mtDNAs) have been acquired by periodic capture from transient hosts. We
      sequenced 449 complete mtDNAs from a global population of CTVTs, and show that
      mtDNA horizontal transfer has occurred at least five times, delineating five
      tumour clades whose distributions track two millennia of dog global migration.
      Negative selection has operated to prevent accumulation of deleterious mutations 
      in captured mtDNA, and recombination has caused occasional mtDNA re-assortment.
      These findings implicate functional mtDNA as a driver of CTVT global metastatic
      spread, further highlighting the important role of mtDNA in cancer evolution.

AB  - Infection with helminthic parasites, including the soil-transmitted helminth
      Trichuris trichiura (human whipworm), has been shown to modulate host immune
      responses and, consequently, to have an impact on the development and
      manifestation of chronic human inflammatory diseases. De novo derivation of
      helminth proteomes from sequencing of transcriptomes will provide valuable data
      to aid identification of parasite proteins that could be evaluated as potential
      immunotherapeutic molecules in near future. Herein, we characterized the
      transcriptome of the adult stage of the human whipworm T. trichiura, using
      next-generation sequencing technology and a de novo assembly strategy. Nearly
      17.6 million high-quality clean reads were assembled into 6414 contiguous
      sequences, with an N50 of 1606bp. In total, 5673 protein-encoding sequences were 
      confidentially identified in the T. trichiura adult worm transcriptome; of these,
      1013 sequences represent potential newly discovered proteins for the species,
      most of which presenting orthologs already annotated in the related species T.
      suis. A number of transcripts representing probable novel non-coding transcripts 
      for the species T. trichiura were also identified. Among the most abundant
      transcripts, we found sequences that code for proteins involved in lipid
      transport, such as vitellogenins, and several chitin-binding proteins. Through a 
      cross-species expression analysis of gene orthologs shared by T. trichiura and
      the closely related parasites T. suis and T. muris it was possible to find
      twenty-six protein-encoding genes that are consistently highly expressed in the
      adult stages of the three helminth species. Additionally, twenty transcripts
      could be identified that code for proteins previously detected by mass
      spectrometry analysis of protein fractions of the whipworm somatic extract that
      present immunomodulatory activities. Five of these transcripts were amongst the
      most highly expressed protein-encoding sequences in the T. trichiura adult worm. 
      Besides, orthologs of proteins demonstrated to have potent immunomodulatory
      properties in related parasitic helminths were also predicted from the T.
      trichiura de novo assembled transcriptome.

      watches, individual genomic information and preventive healthcare and medicine.
      This may benefit each one of us not only individually but also society as a whole
      through iPH (individualized preventive healthcare). This shift driven by genomic 
      and other technologies may well also change the relationship between patient and 
      physician by empowering the former but giving him/her also much more individual
      responsibility.

TI  - Population genomics of parallel hybrid zones in the mimetic butterflies, H.
      melpomene and H. erato.
PG  - 1316-33
LID - 10.1101/gr.169292.113 [doi]
AB  - Hybrid zones can be valuable tools for studying evolution and identifying genomic
      regions responsible for adaptive divergence and underlying phenotypic variation. 
      Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and 
      are maintained by strong selection acting on color pattern. The comimetic
      species, H. erato and H. melpomene, have parallel hybrid zones in which both
      species undergo a change from one color pattern form to another. We use
      restriction-associated DNA sequencing to obtain several thousand genome-wide
      sequence markers and use these to analyze patterns of population divergence
      across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two
      approaches for analysis of this type of data-alignment to a reference genome and 
      de novo assembly-and find that alignment gives the best results for species both 
      closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. erato, approximately 15% divergent)
      related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that the color pattern
      controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions across the genome,
      but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to color pattern
      differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously unmapped
      color pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus. Finally, we identify a new
      cryptic population of H. timareta in Ecuador, which occurs at relatively low
      altitude and is mimetic with H. melpomene malleti.

TI  - Population genomics of the endangered giant Galapagos tortoise.
PG  - R136
LID - 10.1186/gb-2013-14-12-r136 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The giant Galapagos tortoise, Chelonoidis nigra, is a large-sized
      terrestrial chelonian of high patrimonial interest. The species recently
      colonized a small continental archipelago, the Galapagos Islands, where it has
      been facing novel environmental conditions and limited resource availability. To 
      explore the genomic consequences of this ecological shift, we analyze the
      transcriptomic variability of five individuals of C. nigra, and compare it to
      similar data obtained from several continental species of turtles. RESULTS:
      Having clarified the timing of divergence in the Chelonoidis genus, we report in 
      C. nigra a very low level of genetic polymorphism, signatures of a weakened
      efficacy of purifying selection, and an elevated mutation load in coding and
      regulatory sequences. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of an
      extremely low long-term effective population size in this insular species.
      Functional evolutionary analyses reveal a reduced diversity of immunity genes in 
      C. nigra, in line with the hypothesis of attenuated pathogen diversity in
      islands, and an increased selective pressure on genes involved in response to
      stress, potentially related to the climatic instability of its environment and
      its elongated lifespan. Finally, we detect no population structure or
      homozygosity excess in our five-individual sample. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      enlighten the molecular evolution of an endangered taxon in a stressful
      environment and point to island endemic species as a promising model for the
      study of the deleterious effects on genome evolution of a reduced long-term
      population size.

AB  - Ecuador has a heterogeneous population of almost 14 million people and a complex 
      health care system provided through provincial and national health programs by
      government and private hospitals. There are public health facilities at regional 
      and territorial level. Ecuador has a small cadre of genetic professionals that
      provide clinical genetic services in a few private medical centers in the main
      cities. Prenatal screening is offered exclusively in a few individual hospitals, 
      with variable uptake as part of prenatal care. Surveillance of the effect of
      prenatal screening and diagnosis on the birth prevalence of congenital anomalies 
      is limited by gaps and variations in surveillance systems. Newborn screening
      programs are almost inexistent. There is broad variation in optional
      participation in laboratory quality assurance schemes, and there are no
      regulatory frameworks that are directly pertinent to genetic testing services or 
      population genetics. Health technology assessment in Ecuador is conducted by a
      diverse collection of organizations, several of which have produced reports
      related to genetics.

      what's new from this old foe?

AB  - UNLABELLED: Moniliophthora perniciosa (=Crinipellis perniciosa) causes one of the
      three main fungal diseases of Theobroma cacao (cacao), the source of chocolate.
      This pathogen causes Witches' broom disease (WBD) and has brought about severe
      economic losses in all of the cacao-growing regions to which it has spread with
      yield reductions that range from 50 to 90%. Cacao production in South America
      reflects the severity of this pathogen, as the yields in most of the infected
      regions have not returned to pre-outbreak levels, even with the introduction of
      resistant varieties. In this review we give a brief historical account and
      summarize the current state of knowledge focusing on developments in the areas of
      systematics, fungal physiology, biochemistry, genomics and gene expression in an 
      attempt to highlight this disease. Moniliophthora perniciosa is a hemibiotrophic 
      fungus with two distinct growth phases. The ability to culture a biotrophic-like 
      phase in vitro along with new findings derived from the nearly complete genome
      and expression studies clearly show that these different fungal growth phases
      function under distinct metabolic parameters. These new findings have greatly
      improved our understanding of this fungal/host interaction and we may be at the
      crossroads of understanding how hemibiotrophic fungal plant pathogens cause
      disease in other crops. HISTORICAL SUMMARY OF WBD: The first WDB symptoms appear 
      to have been described in the diaries of Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira (described 
      as lagartao; meaning big lizard) from his observations of cacao trees in 1785 and
      1787 in Amazonia, which is consistent with the generally accepted idea that M.
      perniciosa, like its main host T. cacao, evolved in this region. The disease
      subsequently arrived in Surinam in 1895. WBD moved rapidly, spreading to Guyana
      in 1906, Ecuador in 1918, Trinidad in 1928, Colombia in 1929 and Grenada in 1948.
      In each case, cacao production was catastrophically affected with yield
      reductions of 50-90%. After the arrival of M. perniciosa in Bahia in 1989, Brazil
      went from being the world's 3rd largest producer of cacao (347 000 tonnes in
      1988-1990; c. 15% of the total world production at that time) to a net importer
      (141 000 tonnes in 1998-2000). Fortunately for chocolate lovers, other regions of
      the world such as West Africa and South East Asia have not yet been affected by
      this disease and have expanded production to meet growing world demand (predicted
      to reach 3 700 000 tonnes by 2010). CLASSIFICATION: Moniliophthora perniciosa
      (Stahel) Aime & Phillips-Mora: super-kingdom Eukaryota; kingdom Fungi; phylum
      Basidiomycota; subphylum Agaricomycotina; class Agaricomycetes; subclass
      Agaricomycetidae; order Agaricales; family Marasmiaceae; genus Moniliophthora.
